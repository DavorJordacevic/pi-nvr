# Raspberry Pi NVR Configuration

This repository contains a Raspberry Pi NVR configuration so a Pi 4 or CM4 can be used as an NVR, or Network Video Recorder, for capturing and managing CCTV/IP camera streams.

Currently I'm experimenting with which DVR application I'm going to use. So I'm not updating the README further until I pick something.

See the 'NVR Solutions' section below for current thoughts.

## Raspberry Pi Setup

For an NVR, you're going to want to use storage other than built-in eMMC (CM4 only) or microSD (Lite CM4 or Pi 4 model B). For my own purposes, I'm booting a Pi off of an NVMe drive, using the new [native NVMe boot option](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/raspberry-pi-can-boot-nvme-ssds-now) on the CM4.

You also need a lot of storageâ€”multiple TB of storage is best if you want any form of long-term archive.

And finally, some applications like Frigate work great if you add on something like Google Coral TPU via USB. But for now I'm not doing that.

To prep the Pi, make sure you are running the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS, can reach the Pi over SSH, and can log into it with something like `ssh pi@dvr.local` (that's the default address I'm using to test).

## Installation

TODO. Install Ansible, run playbook.

```
ansible-playbook main.yml
```

Then run specific NVR playbook, e.g.

```
ansible-playbook shinobi/main.yml
```

### Shinobi First-time setup

After the playbook completes, visit the URL of your NVR, at the `/super` path, e.g. `http://dvr.local:8080/super`. The default login credentials are:

  - Email: `admin@shinobi.video`
  - Password: `admin`

TODO.

## Raspberry Pi NVR Solutions

Here are my notes on different options for DVR/NVR/CCTV solutions that could run on the Pi:

  - Shinobi (https://shinobi.video)
    - Guide: https://www.heystephenwood.com/2018/08/shinobi-on-raspberry-pi-3-b.html
    - Seems popular, well supported
    - Docker image only available for arm32v7 right now (see: https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-nvr/issues/1)
  - Frigate (https://docs.frigate.video)
    - Use with Google Coral TPU... https://docs.frigate.video/hardware
    - Runs in Docker, though storage configuration can be annoying
    - Seems to integrate *really* well with Home Assistant
    - Requires an MQTT server elsewhere?
  - ZoneMinder (https://zoneminder.com)
    - Pi guide: https://wiki.zoneminder.com/Raspberry_Pi_4_-_Raspbian
    - Old and trusted... but also harder to configure
    - No official Docker images for arm64v8, but [this one](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/nardo86/zoneminder) seems okay.
  - MotionEyeOS (https://github.com/motioneye-project/motioneyeos)
    - Latest release from October 2020... which is kinda old. Dev work to get on Python 3...
  - Orchid Core from IPConfigure (https://www.ipconfigure.com/download)
    - Unlimited cameras, but they do like you to use licensed version maybe. Not open source?
  - PiNVR (https://www.pinvr.net)
    - Cool logo, but beta not open, Forums look spammed out
  - On-NAS Surveillance Center (ASUSTOR)
    - Even though it's proprietary, I wanted to see if it was plug-and-play
    - Safari plugin doesn't seem to work with latest Safari
